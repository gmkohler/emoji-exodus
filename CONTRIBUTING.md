# 🏗 CONTRIBUTING

## 🔐 don't push to master

- 🌳 Please make a branch/PR when contributing rather than pushing to master.
- 💬 Please seek a review before merging unless it's a readme change or something similar.

## ✨ Emoji in commit messages

- 🎨 You must precede each commit message with a representative emoji.  To use emoji from the command line, use `⌘+⇧+␣` to open up the symbol input tool, then search for your desired emoji.  For instance:

  ```sh
  git add CONTRIBUTING.md
  git commit -m "📖 add contribution guidelines"
  ```
