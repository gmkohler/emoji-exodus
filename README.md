# emoji-exodus
A way to move emoji from one Slack instance to another


## Setup

- Clone this repo

- From within the cloned directory, create and activate a virtual environment via `venv` ([instructions](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/))

  ```sh
    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
  ```
  You will know if this worked if you see a `(env)` at the beginning of your CLI prompt.

- Install the packages via `pip3`:

  ```sh
  (env) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
