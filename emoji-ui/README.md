# About This Project

This is an optional web UI for the emoji-transferer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting Set Up

You will also want to be running the python server at the same time:

```
# in project directory
source env/bin/activate # if not already activated
python3 app.py
```

Then you can start up the ui:

```
cd emoji-ui
yarn install

# Start a local server
yarn start
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000/

# Tests

There aren't really any yet but you'd run them with `yarn test` if there were.
